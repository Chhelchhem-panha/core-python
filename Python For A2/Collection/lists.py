# Collection = single "variable" used to store multiple values
# List = [] ordered and changeable. Duplicates OK
# Set = {} unordered and immutable, but add/remove OK. NO duplicates
# Tuple = () ordered and unchangeable. Duplicates OK. FASTER

#  changeable means that the collection can be modified after it has been created.
#  For example, in Python, a list is changeable,
#  meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created

#  unchangeable means that the collection cannot be modified after it has been created.
#  For example, in Python, a set is unchangeable,
#  meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
#  Once a set is created, you cannot change its items,
#  but you can remove items and add new items

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pineapple", "mango"]
drinks = ["coke", "spite", "sting", "fanta"]

# if we used index by -1 it will go to the last value
# print(fruits[-1])
# print(fruits[0:3])

# Modifying
# fruits.append("Panda")
# fruits.pop()
# result = fruits.insert(1, "Macbook")
# fruits[2] = "Macbook"
# print(fruits)

# print(fruits.__dir__())
# print('art' in fruits)
# for item in fruits:
#     print(item)
